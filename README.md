Personal Website for my portfolio.

- Well, I had an idea of creating an Angular Application but then clearing full time interviews is more important than anything. 
- So, Here is my Personal Website from the Academic Theme created for Hugo.

## HighLights

This theme is not bad at all. It even has an option to create posts or template recent talks and publications simply using Markdown. 

- The fun stops here for now. 
- I look forward for an interesting future. 
Btw, I just turned 24 Yesterday. Time flies, we humans can perceive time in one direction. Too bad :(
